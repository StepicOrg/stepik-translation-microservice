    # The command key overrides the default image command (gunicorn server),
    # allowing auto-code reload in development.
    # The command is tweaked to allow the local server to be accessed
    # by cross-origin requests (by binding to system IP 0.0.0.0 rather than localhost).

  # Technically, we could access the server using port 8000 without in dev.
  # But, running the proxy, and accessing the server through it on port 80, mirrors
  # the exact production environment.
