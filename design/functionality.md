## MVP

* models for translation service, Azure, Yandex, Google
* model Translated and inherit from it: translated step and lesson
* get translated by pk + pagination
* test accuracy of Azure, Yandex, Google
* get used langages in project
* choose 1 course and make full translation
* tests for API
* postgresql for storing lessons, steps
* post request `update` and `create` translation

## Desirable functionality

* made access for APi by token + security
* admin page with auth for accept translation, count price of course translation 
* job for update accepted translation for lesson, step, course
* handle all exceptions
* get translation ratio of the course lesson
* don't forget about copyright when go in production
* think about marketing
* docker and deploy
* swagger documentation + instructions
* linter + travis
* landing page for suggesting translations
* use 3-rd party service for mistake correction
* translate schemes, ru->all (yandex), es->en(google)

## Future

* translate subtitles, interface
* open source framework for useful django-translation (Stepik interface)
